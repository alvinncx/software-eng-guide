## Preface

Tech is so hot, it is expected that demand will continue to outstrip supply into the next decade. This is already the market norm even before Covid-19; and with Covid-19 further accelerating digital change across the world, tech will become indispensible. Make no mistake, software will eat the world.

With tech making the headlines and tech giants setting up tech hubs in Singapore, it is only natural for locals to be considering a career switch to be a software engineer. Many are also considering a change because of how Covid-19 has brought to light the dispensibility of their current roles.

While tech is important and here to stay, I also fundamentally believe that everyone has their part and role in the society. A career in software engineering is rewarding, but has its own unique challenges not found in other careers as well. I hope I can provide some perspective on this, and hopefully guide you in your journey should you choose to make a career switch.
