## Preface

Tech is so hot, it is expected that demand will continue to outstrip supply into the next decade. This is already the market norm even before Covid-19; and with Covid-19 further accelerating digital change across the world, tech will become indispensible. Make no mistake, software will eat the world.

With tech making the headlines and tech giants setting up tech hubs in Singapore, it is only natural for locals to be considering a career switch to be a software engineer. Many are also considering a change because of how Covid-19 has brought to light the dispensibility of their current roles.

While tech is important and here to stay, I also fundamentally believe that everyone has their part and role in the society. A career in software engineering is rewarding, but has its own unique challenges not found in other careers as well. I hope I can provide some perspective on this, and hopefully guide you in your journey should you choose to make a career switch.

## Industry overview and opportunities

A career as a software engineer can begin anywhere and take you everywhere. Often what drives us is the problem set that we are working on. One can be working in Finance systems for a good part of their career, and then later find themselves in a completely different business domain solving problems in E-commerce.

### Tech giants

Among the tech world, it is common to refer to them as FAANG — collectively Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (*Actually I haven't heard of the Asian equivalent, maybe STAB? SEA, Tencent, Alibaba, and Bytedance?*)

These are the coveted companies that many software engineers aspire to join. They offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunitiy to work on tech-driven products that can impact the entire world. 

As such they hire the very-very-very best among software engineers; many of whom have made significant leaps and achievements during their university or pre-varsity days by joining competitions, contributing to open source or just generally coding for fun a lot. They are ultra-smart people and their by-products (for the lack of a better word) are often libraries of code that the vast majority of the software engineering world adopt.

Should a mid-career software engineer *aspire* to join them? Absolutely. 

But realistically will one be able to make it? It is very hard to say but from my research while working at a recruitment company, the answer is *very unlikely*.

And yes, their crazy high salaries and awesome benefits are all true (ok, mostly true.). At their level, money is no option. Usually people quit not because they hate their job, it is because they no longer identify with the company's values (how great that self-actualisation is your daily worry.)

### Consultancies / Digital Agencies

You may have come across them in your current career. They are the IT agencies that your company might have recruited to build a new system or software for your company. They all function generally in one of 2 ways

- Project-based. A consultancy is engaged to deliver a project. As a software engineer, you are tasked to build it together with a team. You may or may not interact with the client company.
- Outsourcing. You may be trained by the consultancy, but attached to a client that you have no control over. You generally build what the client asks you to build and at the end of the day your payroll comes from the consultancy.

They generally can be split into a few sub-categories:

#### International IT Consultancies

Here you have your Accenture, Pivotal, Zulkhe, ThoughtWorks, Cognizant, Palo IT, etc. With a staff count of 10,000+ and more, they are spilt into so many satellite teams, so the work quality and work-life balance can vary a lot.

In most cases you will be working on a large IT project in an MNC. They cost big bucks (management fats, or so I hear) so only big players can hire them.

#### Local IT Agencies

In Singapore we have players like 2359 Media, Titansoft, Codigo, etc. They generally focus on projects for local or regional clients. Likewise, quality and work life balance varies widely according to agency.

In all honesty, as a mid-career switcher, this is where you will likely start in. The projects here are not world-scale daunting, but sufficiently big enough for you to quickly learn the ropes.

#### IT "Sweatshop"

You may hear this term used to describe some IT consultancies. If you do, try to avoid them. These are places where software and code are sold at the lowest prices.

To my knowledge there aren't any "sweatshops" in Singapore. But at least now you know what our lingo 😏.

### Tech Startups / Software companies

These are the people who are probably making big bucks in this tech wave. One very good thing about these companies is that software is the backbone, so as a software engineer you are pretty much a "first-class citizen"—or at worst just 2nd class after the product manager.

As an mid-career switcher, it is therefore important to research the potential industry / product type and list of companies that you would like to work it. A non exhaustive list:

- Sales software (SalesWhale)
- Payroll systems (StaffAny)
- Financial analysis software (NumTech)
- Chat software (Zendesk)
- Logistics (Ninja Van)
- Artificial Intelligence (YiTu)

### In-house

You can also work as an software engineer in an in house team. This is common in banks like DBS, Standard Chartered, etc. or larger local companies like SP Group where they hire lots of engineers to work on their systems. 

As a in-house engineer, you will likely be tasked to work on a legacy system, either squashing bugs or adding new features to an aging system.

As a mid-career switcher, it can be hard working in these companies because the systems can be vast, old and hard to understand without knowing industry norms. No only must you pick up business domain knowledge, you need to learn to code on the job as well.

### Freelance

And finally, if you hate reporting to a boss, you can decide to freelance! Crazy I know, but software can be delivered anywhere in the world, so you can work from home and receive clients worldwide.

Of course, it works both ways; you will have competition on an **international** level. Apart from the command of English, there is almost no advantage to being a Singaporean on the world's freelance stage. In fact, due to our higher cost of living, it is difficult for locals to out bid other projects in terms of cost. 

You might get this to work out somehow if you have strong network and branding, but as a mid-career switcher, *highly unlikely* as well.
