## Preface

Tech is so hot, it is expected that demand will continue to outstrip supply into the next decade. This is already the market norm even before Covid-19; and with Covid-19 further accelerating digital change across the world, tech will become indispensible. Make no mistake, software will eat the world.

With tech making the headlines and tech giants setting up tech hubs in Singapore, it is only natural for locals to be considering a career switch to be a software engineer. Many are also considering a change because of how Covid-19 has brought to light the dispensibility of their current roles.

While tech is important and here to stay, I also fundamentally believe that everyone has their part and role in the society. A career in software engineering is rewarding, but has its own unique challenges not found in other careers as well. I hope I can provide some perspective on this, and hopefully guide you in your journey should you choose to make a career switch.

## Industry overview and opportunities

A career as a software engineer can begin anywhere and take you everywhere. Often what drives us is the problem set that we are working on. One can be working in Finance systems for a good part of their career, and then later find themselves in a completely different business domain solving problems in E-commerce.

### Tech giants

Among the tech world, it is common to refer to them as FAANG — collectively Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (*Actually I haven't heard of the Asian equivalent, maybe STAB? SEA, Tencent, Alibaba, and Bytedance?*)

These are the coveted companies that many software engineers aspire to join. They offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunitiy to work on tech-driven products that can impact the entire world. 

As such they hire the very-very-very best among software engineers; many of whom have made significant leaps and achievements during their university or pre-varsity days by joining competitions, contributing to open source or just generally coding for fun a lot. They are ultra-smart people and their by-products (for the lack of a better word) are often libraries of code that the vast majority of the software engineering world adopt.

Should a mid-career software engineer *aspire* to join them? Absolutely. 

But realistically will one be able to make it? It is very hard to say but from my research while working at a recruitment company, the answer is *very unlikely*.

And yes, their crazy high salaries and awesome benefits are all true (ok, mostly true.). At their level, money is no option. Usually people quit not because they hate their job, it is because they no longer identify with the company's values (how great that self-actualisation is your daily worry.)

### Consultancies / Digital Agencies

You may have come across them in your current career. They are the IT agencies that your company might have recruited to build a new system or software for your company. They all function generally in one of 2 ways

- Project-based. A consultancy is engaged to deliver a project. As a software engineer, you are tasked to build it together with a team. You may or may not interact with the client company.
- Outsourcing. You may be trained by the consultancy, but attached to a client that you have no control over. You generally build what the client asks you to build and at the end of the day your payroll comes from the consultancy.

They generally can be split into a few sub-categories:

#### International IT Consultancies

Here you have your Accenture, Pivotal, Zulkhe, ThoughtWorks, Cognizant, Palo IT, etc. With a staff count of 10,000+ and more, they are spilt into so many satellite teams, so the work quality and work-life balance can vary a lot.

In most cases you will be working on a large IT project in an MNC. They cost big bucks (management fats, or so I hear) so only big players can hire them.

#### Local IT Agencies

In Singapore we have players like 2359 Media, Titansoft, Codigo, etc. They generally focus on projects for local or regional clients. Likewise, quality and work life balance varies widely according to agency.

In all honesty, as a mid-career switcher, this is where you will likely start in. The projects here are not world-scale daunting, but sufficiently big enough for you to quickly learn the ropes.

#### IT "Sweatshop"

You may hear this term used to describe some IT consultancies. If you do, try to avoid them. These are places where software and code are sold at the lowest prices.

To my knowledge there aren't any "sweatshops" in Singapore. But at least now you know what our lingo 😏.

### Tech Startups / Software companies

These are the people who are probably making big bucks in this tech wave. One very good thing about these companies is that software is the backbone, so as a software engineer you are pretty much a "first-class citizen"—or at worst just 2nd class after the product manager.

As an mid-career switcher, it is therefore important to research the potential industry / product type and list of companies that you would like to work it. A non exhaustive list:

- Sales software (SalesWhale)
- Payroll systems (StaffAny)
- Financial analysis software (NumTech)
- Chat software (Zendesk)
- Logistics (Ninja Van)
- Artificial Intelligence (YiTu)

### In-house

You can also work as an software engineer in an in house team. This is common in banks like DBS, Standard Chartered, etc. or larger local companies like SP Group where they hire lots of engineers to work on their systems. 

As a in-house engineer, you will likely be tasked to work on a legacy system, either squashing bugs or adding new features to an aging system.

As a mid-career switcher, it can be difficult working in these companies because the systems can be vast, old and hard to understand without knowing industry norms. Not only must you pick up business domain knowledge, you need to learn to code on the job as well.

### Freelance

And finally, if you hate reporting to a boss, you can decide to freelance! Crazy I know, but software can be delivered anywhere in the world, so you can work from home and receive clients worldwide.

Of course, it works both ways; you will have competition on an **international** level. Apart from the command of English, there is almost no advantage to being a Singaporean on the world's freelance stage. In fact, due to our higher cost of living, it is difficult for locals to out bid other projects in terms of cost. 

You might get this to work out somehow if you have strong network and branding, but as a mid-career switcher, *highly unlikely* as well.

## Is a Software Engineering career for you?

Perhaps you've seen all the cool apps and websites that permate your everyday life and find yourself asking "wow, I'd love to build another cool stuff like that." Many engineers start off thinking that is how their career will pan out, but in most cases are disappointed to find out the daily work **can be quite dreary**. Here, I will be presenting to you the truth in spades.

#### You have to constantly learn. And I mean CONSTANTLY.

Software engineering is among the fastest changing fields. Just to give an example, just over a span of 8-10 years, one of the most popular web frameworks Ruby on Rails, went from meteoric rise to fall to obsurity. 

You can imagine the people who bet on Ruby on Rails many years ago now find themselves no longer being hired, their once useful skills no longer in demand. About 5 years ago, job boards were full of jobs looking for Ruby developers. Now in 2020, there are only calls to maintain Ruby based projects. This is not an isolated case.

Heard of Docker? 5 years ago if you asked anyone, they though you meant the ships. Now, Docker is in almost every software project.

Heard of the cloud? 8-10 years ago if you said you ran on the cloud, people thought you meant the rain. Now in 2020? EVERYONE runs their servers on the cloud.

Remember servers? That machine that you were told to never turn off the power? That is so 2018. With Amazon/Google/AliCloud now pushing for *serverless*, you don't even need a server any more. But wait, if there are no servers then how...

That is how fast the software engineering field is changing. I like to say that the field of software engineering changes faster than the time to get a degree. If you are excited by changes, then this career is perfect for you. If not, you may want to think twice.

#### No, just learning a language is not enough

Somehow even computer science graduates think that learning Java / Python is enough to get them to start a career. Well not exactly, because software engineering is more than just programming. 

Programming in your favorite language is just the tip of the ice berg. In real systems, you need to deploy systems in to servers so now you need to learn how servers work.

In some companies you may use containers to deploy, so now you need to learn Docker.

In all likelyhood you will be a web software engineer, so you can't escape HTML, CSS and Javascipt. So there's more to learn.

You may write code that is messy, so you need to learn how to refactor your code.

Your team may favor object orientated programming, so you have to learn those patterns. Or functional programming, so you have to learn again.

You have to make sure the data is stored, so now you need to figure out how to use a database. Or if you need to only store it temporarily you might only need a cache. 

You most certainly need to take programming tests to land a job, so you need to learn how to use data structures effectively.

So is only learning a language enough? No. Thoughout your career, you most likely have to pick up new languages, techniques and technologies along the way.

#### You need to do the dirty, tedious work too

It is a common phenomenon for software projects to eventually reach a point where a step forwards is also a step backwards. 

Picture this: You are tasked to untangle a huge ball of wires. You might have to disconnect them carefully, sort them out by colours and group them by function and purpose and then lay them down nicely so it doesn't happen again. Tedious? Maybe it takes you 1 day to do this.

Now imagine this ball is not isolated. It is EVERYWHERE in your house, you block the corridor the entire building. Most days you can walk past them, must some days you need to do something where the ball of wires get in the way. Do you untangle them? Do you leave them be?

What if after you have untangled them, someone comes along and tangle them up? Worst, what if you are the one who tangled up a bunch of wires? 

**About 70% of work in most software projects is dealing with past mistakes.** And to survive the day to day tedium, you have to find joy in making code read beautifully and systems running flawlessly. Successful engineers I know are compulsively see the need to clean up code, and spend significant time doing so.

And don't think for a second that *"oh I'm gonna be a frontend engineer so I only make beautiful stuff"*. Sometimes I pity the frontend engineers because frontend is a false utopia. Ask any frontend engineer about IE browser compatibility, CSS styling inheritance clashing and state management and you know it is real hell.
